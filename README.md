PostQuantum is a Chrome extension that allows users to encrypt their important messages with OTP. This encryption cannot be broken, even by quantum computers.

How to install:
To install PostQuantum, simply open the Chrome web store and search for PostQuantum. You should see the extension. Click on it and click "Add To Chrome".

How to use:
Once you have installed the extension, you will have to restart Chrome for it to take effect. Once you have done this, you can open the extension popup to get started. Click the puzzle piece icon in the top right of Chrome, then click on "PostQuantum". Click the "Get a New Key" button to get a new encryption key, then click "Load Key" to be able to use it. Once you have done this, you can now select some text (it must be editable) and right click on it. If all is working, you should now see a "PostQuantum" button. Hover over this and you will see two options "Encrypt OTP" and "Decrypt OTP". The purpose and use of these buttons should be self explanatory. For further information, read the text in the popup.
